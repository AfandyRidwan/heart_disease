# About
## Heart Disease Prediction Using MLPClassifier()

### Overview
Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project! This project focuses on utilizing a machine learning model for the prediction of heart disease. Heart disease is a significant health concern worldwide, and this project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to aid in its early detection.

### Library Usage
This project makes use of several key libraries and frameworks, including:

1. scikit-learn (sklearn): Used for machine learning model building and evaluation.

2. NumPy: Utilized for numerical computations and data manipulation.

3. Matplotlib: Employed for data visualization and creating informative charts and graphs.

4. Seaborn: Enhances data visualization by providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

5. Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, including data preprocessing and cleaning.
